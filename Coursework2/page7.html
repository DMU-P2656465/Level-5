<h1>The Reveal</h1>

<p>The murderer of Sophie Smith was in fact....</p>


<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 600px;"

    Her Father.</p>
    
    <br><br><br><br>
    
    
    
<p>His alibi did not make any sense. And he eventually admitted to being jealous of how intellegent his daughter was, he just had to get rid of her, he couldn't deal with the anger he felt of Sophie not persuing the career he wanted her to.


    Although Sophie's partner was also arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, there was very little evidence that he committed the murder itself, as he wanted to keep her alive, and her Father cracked and pled guilty.
