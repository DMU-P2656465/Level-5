<h1>EVIDENCE</h1>

<p>The video below shows where police beleive Sophie went during the night of the murder before her body was found. There are some gaps within the step
    tracing, so police can't truly identify where Sophie was at exact moments in time. But they can estimate the times based on CCTV footage and witness
    appeals
