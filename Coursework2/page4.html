    <h1>EVIDENCE</h1>

<p>Some more evidence that has been released by the 
    police include some text messages between Sophie
    and her partner. Some of these texts shown can be
    distressing, but it is vital for evidence. 
    These messages clearly show some kind of power
    imbalance within the two parties of the relationship.
    These messages were found in the archives of sophie's 
    partners phone, proving to be very suspicious if
    he is hiding messages that are extremely important 
    within an investigation like this. </p>
