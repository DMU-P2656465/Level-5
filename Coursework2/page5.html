   <h1>EVIDENCE</h1>
    


   <p>As discussed previously, Sophie never had a great relationship 
    with her father, they often clashed and had disagreements about
    her career, after he wanted her to have a successful career
    that is stereotypically more academic, like being a doctor or a vet.
    As Sophie grew older she realised this isn't what she wanted to do,
    and so she became a journalist. Her mother was very happy with her 
    decision, but her Father was not. 


    Sophie had lots of friends around her, and everyone was heartbroken about
    her death, her funeral consisted of lots of colour and her father created a
    speech that did not seem sympathetic, while her mother was distraught about her 
    daughter's death. Her mother assumed it was toxic masculinity that allowed her husband
    to not show emotion during the service.
